            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Moreover, the Learned Hebrician <hi>Buxtorfius</hi> rendreth the word <hi>praestigiis utens, praestigiator,</hi> a jugler. Hee saith: The wise antients derived the word from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap> an eye: and that they have written <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> an eye.</p>
            <p>But though the word be read an observer of times; yet pure Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie is not spoken against thereby. It speaketh of such observing of times which the wicked <hi>Canaanites</hi> used, in whom the ill Spirit ruled and reigned. And that there is some lawfull observing of times, continuall experience teacheth it, in Physitians, Husbandmen, Marriners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Who by observing of times about matters in the common course of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, doe prevent many inconveniencies and dangers, which they foresee likely to come to passe.</p>
            <p>Wee will conclude this Answere with Learned <hi>Osianders</hi> delivery on the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word, who writeth: <hi>Hi creduntur esse ii, qui certis incantationibus homines, aut jumenta curaturos se promittunt: item qui horas observant, non Physice, juxta motum Lunae alio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumve planetarum: sed superstitiose, nulla evidente ratione.

            <p>Obj. Only Christ the great Prophet, and they to whom he gives the divinely inspired gift of Prophecie, must foretell things to come: no art may undertake it; for it is opposite unto Christ.</p>
            <p>Ans. There is Prophecie concerning Matters Spirituall, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy concerning Matters Naturall. Astrologie teacheth, what is likely to come to passe in things according to the set course of Nature.<note n="*" place="margin">Cor. 12.28.4.11, 12, 13.</note>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:206372:17"/> It is true also, God hath given unto his people his Christ, and he hath ordained Ministers to teach. We have also his most holy<note n="f" place="margin">Colos. 3 16.</note> Word, unto every tittle and jote whereof we are duly to<note n="g" place="margin">John 12.48. 1 Pet. 1.19.</note> attend; and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> signifieth, we should strive to<note n="h" place="margin">Col. 1.25.

            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> It is said:<note n="i" place="margin">Isa. 2.6.</note> Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people, because they are Southsayers like the <hi>Philistims,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore for their Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God had forsaken them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> If it can be proved, that Soothsaying is any part of true Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, then the argument holdeth against it. But whereas it cannot bee so demonstrated; therefore the Objection is void of power.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> If it can be proved, that true Astrologie hath in it any lying tokens, that any lying tokens are grounds in the said Art or Science, then there is some likelihood of truth in the Application: but whereas it cannot be proved, therefore the Inference is not true.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> It is said:<note n="l" place="margin">Isa. 47.13.</note> Let now the Astrologers, the Starre-gazers, the Monethly Prognosticators stand up, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sure enough here Astrologers expresly, and under severall other names and notions also are bitterly inveighed against.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Let us see whether the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Word signifieth Astrologers, It is rendred in the Margent, <hi>Viewers of the Heavens.</hi> And others are viewers of the Heavens besides Astrologers, as Astronomers, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Philosophers, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But Objection is, That it is a viewing of the heavens for to declare some matter to come to passe thereby. And is it a sinne, to view the heavens, for to see what is likely to fall forth, according to the common course of Nature, and in naturall things?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But the next speech <hi>Starre-gazers</hi> hath the word Starres therein: and therefore it must needs meane Astrologers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The Hebrew is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap> which <hi>Shindler</hi> turneth <hi>videntes in stellis,</hi> seers in the Starres. It appeareth, that it is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely forbidden unto any for to looke into the Stars: for then Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy it self were unlawfull.</p>
            <p>The last speech is the <hi>Monethly Prognosticators.</hi> The Margent saith
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:206372:18"/> the Hebrew is, <hi>that give knowlede concerning the Moneths.</hi> And is it unlawfull to make a Prognostication, to set downe concerning every moneth in the yeere, what is considerable according to the common course of nature?

Is it good reason to say, that the profession of Physicke is unlawfull, because some practising therein doe abuse that honourable Science?</p>

               <hi>Obj.</hi> It is said:<note n="*" place="margin">Jer. 10.2.</note> Learne not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signes of Heaven, for the heathen are dism<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The scope and drift of the Prophets words is, that the People of <hi>Israel</hi> should not so stand in awe of the signes of heaven, as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then were.

And whereas hee will do so sometimes, His people are not so to feare the Iudgements signified in the heaven as do the heathen, which know not the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> as if there were no way to escape them; but to remember, what the Lord saith by <hi>Ioel,</hi>
